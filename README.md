# Introduction

The Host Lookup Tool is a simple GUI implementation of `nslookup` in Python. It's aim is to assist with requests for multiple hosts. It can perform a `nslookup` for a single hostname or IP address or, when needed, multiple hostnames or IP addresses. It's primary aim is on the multiple hosts as performing `nslookup` on multiple hosts can be time consuming.

# Getting Started

The application is built with Python but is converted to a Windows binary. Therefore the user should not need Python installed on their system in order to use. Simply run the executable as you would any other.
